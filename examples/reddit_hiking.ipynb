Color me shocked!\n- u/Annual-Beard-5090:\n    So the choices for us as constituents are:\n    \n    1.  A party that really hates working people and is openly hostile to them but plays cultural games to keep them interested. \n    \n    2.  A party that acts like it doesn’t, but really is still backed by monied interests that hate working people.\n    - u/sadetheruiner:\n        The people with money want us to think the battle for the country is left vs right, it’s definitely the haves vs the have nots.\n        - u/Coderado:\n            The culture wars are an intentional distraction to keep us ignorant of the class warfare that hurts all of us non-millionaires.\n        - u/macrofinite:\n            Well, it is left vs right. And there is a rich history of philosophy and praxis within that framework that you are rejecting by fundamentally misunderstanding what left vs right means. \n            \n            I think what you're demonstrating is even more in the interests of the people with money. How are you ever going to actually fight them if you reflexively dismiss the only group that ever really threatened their stranglehold on power?\n            \n            They're the right. And they'd much rather you pat yourself on the back for feeling like you're above that distinction than engage earnestly with the left.\n            - u/Aacron:\n                > Well, it is left vs right\n                \n                \n                There are two elected representatives in the federal government that are leftist. **Two**.\n                \n                \n                Not sure how many governors but I wouldn't be surprised if it was zero.\n                \n                \n                The US has no \"left\".\n            - u/sadetheruiner:\n                Trust me I actively support the left, every election without fail because I know they have my interests in mind then the right by a wide margin. That wasn’t supposed to be a “BoTh SiDeS aRe ThE sAmE” comment. But it’s delusional to think the rich don’t appreciate us fighting amongst ourselves instead of actively resisting the power balance. The bottom half has about 3% of the wealth in the US.\n                - u/_game_over_man_:\n                    I generally think about it in terms of labor vs. non-labor or labor vs. wealth class. As a member of a couple demographics that Republicans despise and attack, I think one thing that unites the vast majority of us, across all demos, is that most of us are labor class. We certainly have our own issues we're concerned about in regards to demographic based rights, but I think the unifying thing is most of us, regardless of who we are, are labor class.\n                    \n                    Left vs. right has become so diluted and co-opted/exploited, that I don't know how much value there is in continuing to use that terminology these days, at least in regard to this kind of issue.\n            - u/AwayMammoth6592:\n                I believe, If you’re looking for someone to blame, don’t look left or right.

Without a new election coming, he's showing his colors.\n        - u/coriolisFX:\n            You can look at his voting record from Congress, he's a Democrat.  He's just not a progressive.\n            - u/byzantinedavid:\n                He is not. He playacted as one for years. He is solidly a Libertarian\n                - u/coriolisFX:\n                    You can look at how right wing groups score him as a better metric.\n                    \n                    Heritage gave him a lifetime score of 18% - just slightly higher than the average democrat's score of 15%.  So he's *slightly* right of center compared to an average democrat but still firmly a liberal.  Libertarian aligned Republicans score in the 80s and 90s on this metric.\n                    \n                    Polis was in Congress 10 years, this is not playacting.\n        - u/chicoconcarne:\n            He's *not* a libertarian if he's backing and signing bills which increase traffic cameras.\n    - u/scannon:\n        Almost all of one party fought for the bill and delivered it to the governor's desk. All of the other party fought against it. One member of the first party (the governor) sided with the other party over his own and killed the bill his party supports.  \n        \n        But sure, both parties are the same...\n        \n        Grow up and stop eating glue.\n        - u/GingerPinoy:\n            They are not the same, but both are absolutely terrible. But will admit that one is worse than the other\n        - u/macrofinite:\n            Don't you think it's time to stop making excuses for the democrats, just because they aren't republicans? This is a 2015 argument in a 2025 world.\n            \n            Look, intentions are irrelevant. Whether its' their intent or not, the democrats can genuflect toward the impossibility of progress.\n            \n            They tried, right!? Who could ask for more than that? But please don't ask the obvious question about why the governor of our own party vetoed our bill! Just thank us for trying soooooo hard. Did I mention how hard we tried? Remember, we aren't republicans! And you're a good person, so you aren't going to vote republican against me, are you? Better not mention any of the obviously disingenuous and manipulative bullshit I've done, then! Just pretend like everything bad happening is exclusively because progress is impossible and the republicans are big meany-heads that thwart us at every turn!\n            \n            Obviously, the adult thing to do would be to pretend as if the undeniable ways in which our party has contributed to all of our current problems, and has absolutely no plan whatsoever to resolve any of those problems do not exist! Adults do not acknowledge horrifying problems! They pretend they don't exist! Duh! Stop being such a glue-eating child with your naive unwillingness to pretend as if reality does not exist!\n            - u/scannon:\n                What on earth are you talking about? \n                \n                This crop of Democrats tried harder and came closer to delivering on one of organized labor's main priorities than any other group of politicians in this state ever has. Sure, they came up short because the governor isn't on board. But to act like this was all talk and excuses is bullshit. A lot of people put in a ton of work to get the bill as far as it got against major internal and external opposition. To interpret that as saying the Dems and Republicans are all the same and hate working people is idiotic.\n            - u/byzantinedavid:\n                They didn't fucking \"try,\" they succeeded. The Libertarian in office plans to veto it, that's not the same thing.\n            - u/Kooky-Builder-44:\n                Touch grass\n    - u/commentingrobot:\n        Legislature Democrats passed this bill, Senate Bill 5 passed the Senate 22-12 along party lines and the House 43-22 also along party lines.\n        \n        The problem here is Polis, who is a centrist billionaire.\n    - u/Agent_Tangerine:\n        Except, in this case, it's not \"a party\", it's one guy. The struggle with not being a fascist party is that there is a variety of opinions, some of which you (and I) are going to disagree with pretty strongly. \n        \n        We don't have a system where \"both sides of opinion bad\" we have one where one party covers 10 percent of the political spectrum on the far right and another party that covers 85 percent of the rest of the political spectrum and then 5 percent of the far left that are pretty much left out to dry. \n        \n        Still a shitshow, but not exactly as simple as you are saying.\n        - u/oath2order:\n            Right? The user you responded to is pretending as if Democrats didn't pass the bill. *Which they did* otherwise we wouldn't be having this discussion.\n    - u/XxGhost14xX:\n        Welcome to the Democratic Party. We need more than 2 choices!\n        - u/RollTh3Maps:\n            Last I checked, Democrats passed the bill. It’s just the Governor holding things up.\n    - u/CZall23:\n        Ya'll limit working class issues to unionization and corporations. That's why there will never be a working class party.\n- u/hanumanCT:\n    I used to be a big Polis fan, but this and the gun legislation are off-putting.\n    - u/AquafreshBandit:\n        He clearly wants to run for President and so in his second term is acting more bipartisan, even though no Republican is going to believe it, and there isn't going to be a 2028 Presidential election, so the whole thing is just an absurd waste of time.\n        - u/pacard:\n            >there isn't going to be a 2028 Presidential election\n            \n            Shit like this sentiment just makes it easier for the people who don't want elections to get away with it.\n            - u/AquafreshBandit:\n                I get where you’re coming from, but it’s already done. People voted for a guy who did nothing while a mob was looking for his own VP. This is what they want.\n                - u/pacard:\n                    Buck up, don't stop fighting.\n                - u/baddonny:\n                    The fuck it’s already done.\n        - u/persondude27:\n            Democrats really will never learn that trying to play centrist doesn't work.\n            \n            They sabotaged Bernie in 2016 and lost, barely won in 2020, and they failed with Kamala in 2024.\n            \n            You can't push the right-> left, but you can push the left away.\n            - u/AquafreshBandit:\n                George McGovern was very left and unfortunately lost 49 states in 1972. Against Nixon, who’d promised to end the Vietnam War in 1968 and then didn’t.\n                \n                But that’s water under the bridge now. People don’t want the Constitution. They want one man to make decisions based on solely his judgement and they’ve got it.\n                - u/baddonny:\n                    No they goddamn don’t. Good lord man, where were you the day they handed out spines?\n                    \n                    Stop talking like a person who wants the US to fall.\n            - u/kralrick:\n                >They sabotaged Bernie in 2016 and lost\n                \n                Bernie lost the 2016 primary by millions of votes, double digit percentage points.  If he was a viable candidate, even with the Democratic party backing Clinton, it would have been a close primary.  \n                \n                I don't think centrism was the problem with the last three Presidential candidates, I think it was the candidates themselves (with the added anchor of not having a primary in 2024).  Obama was a rather moderate candidate in most regards and is often held up as a gold standard for mass voter appeal.\n            - u/philn256:\n                Biden played the centrist game and won, but then went far left. The problem with democrats today is even if they play the centrist game (like Kamala tried) people see right through it.\n                Would Kamala have cracked down illegal immigration at the border? Probably not.\n                - u/persondude27:\n                    LOL, Biden was absolutely not far left. What the hell are you smoking?\n        - u/philn256:\n            If he were trying to run for president he'd have vetoed the gun legislation.\n- u/RandomAsciiSequence:\n    Can anyone explain what is bad about this, specifically? The article just has general complaints from unions, but didn't go into why this is a priority. \n    - u/ConcLaveTime:\n        The Labor Peace Act requires that 75% of workers that will be represented by a union need to vote in favor of paying dues to fund the union. So if a union passes a labor peace act vote all workers represented by the union must pay dues to fund the union representing them and if it fails (this happens almost all the time now) then dues to the union are voluntary. The 75% threshold is incredibly high to pass and makes it or breaks the success of the union. You pass then your union has funds to actually fight if it doesn't pass then good luck getting significant benefit from your pretty toothless union.\n        \n        \n        *This bill would overturn the Labor Peace Act making it easier for Unions to form with a dues paying base of workers\n        - u/johnnyfaceoff:\n            Important to note this 75% comes AFTER the union has been voted in by a simple majority. So it’s basically an extra step to make the formation of an actual labor union more difficult.\n            - u/Iinventedcaptchas:\n                I wouldn't qualify it as an extra step in creating a labor union. The 75% requirement is *after* they've already formed a union. It requires a 75% vote in order to make all employees (whether they're in the union or not) pay fees to the union for the  benefits of collective bargaining. It's what they call union security.\n                - u/johnnyfaceoff:\n                    It is an extra step though, because a union that doesn’t collect dues is pretty powerless, and most people that vote for a union already have the expectation of paying dues to begin with. It’s entirely extra and unnecessary and was put in place in the 70’s to make unions weaker and harder to put into place.\n                    - u/kralrick:\n                        > It requires a 75% vote in order to make all employees (whether they're in the union or not) pay fees to the union for the benefits of collective bargaining.\n                        \n                        Your comment entirely ignores this very important point Iinvented made.  Do you believe it to be a false statement?  Would you be okay if the union vote automatically made all members in the newly formed union have to pay dues but a 75% worker vote was required to make non-union members pay dues?\n                        - u/johnnyfaceoff:\n                            I disagreed with them saying that the 75% vote part isn’t an extra step. It is. That’s all I’m saying. Get the stick out of your ass. I’m in favor of NO extra votes just to get people to pay dues.\n                            - u/kralrick:\n                                So you'd be fine with union members automatically paying union dues when the union is formed and non-union members not having to pay dues to an organization they're not a part of?\n                                \n                                The 75% vote is only an extra step if it's required for union members to be required to pay dues.\n                                - u/johnnyfaceoff:\n                                    No, everybody pays lmao why is this so hard to understand?\n        - u/byzantinedavid:\n            Critically, even WITH the 75%, the Union and the Company have to agree on a dues structure for non-members.\n    - u/None:\n        [deleted]\n        - u/TheyMadeMeLogin:\n            This isn't true, the 75% threshold is needed to force all employees to pay union dues not form the union (as the article says).\n    - u/TrueAkagami:\n        My understanding is that the bill would require everyone to pay union dues whether they are in a union or not. The union's stance is that non-union members benefit from what the union does, but don't pay the fees. This bill basically seem to force everyone to be a part of the union whether they want to or not, or at least force them to pay the dues. I think the bad part is the matter of choice for an employee. That gets taken away if the bill were passed.\n        - u/Threedawg:\n            Non union employees get the same wages and benefits as union employees. If you dont want those benefits and to join the union, find a different job. \n            \n            \n            \n            This right wing \"right to work\" attitude you have is exactly what killed the labor movement in this country.\n            - u/TrueAkagami:\n                Easy killer. Was just giving my opinion about my interpretation of the bill. I don't have any skin in the game on the union battle. I saw a question about what someone thought might be the bad interpretation and gave my opinion. I heard about that a lot when I worked for an organization that had a group of workers in a union. One guy I worked with wasn't in the union and didn't pay dues, but was heavily pressured by the union to join regardless. He said that turned him off to it and that it should be his choice. Just playing devil's advocate here.\n        - u/byzantinedavid:\n            No, this would ALLOW the Union and the Company to include dues for non-members in the contract. It would still require both sides agreeing to the contract provision.\n            - u/TrueAkagami:\n                The article definitely didn't seem quite clear to me, so this would also make sense. So if the Union and the Company include non-member dues in the contract, who is paying that? Is it the company, the non-members? Just legitimately curious.\n                - u/byzantinedavid:\n                    The non-members. Typically, it's a lower amount and doesn't get the union's legal protection, voting rights, benefits, etc. It's mostly just a fee in exchange for the union negotiating and representing you. You still get employment representation, grievances, etc.\n                    \n                    They're called agency fees or fair share fees.\n- u/SavageCucmber:\n    If people didn't learn anything with Hickenlooper, they certainly won't with Polis either.\n- u/lwc28:\n    Polis is part of the pro-business side of the democratic party. It's that idea that they have to compete with Republicans by being more like them, centrist, etc. It's not ok.\n- u/cuulcars:\n    Polis sucks. Let’s get a real progressive in there next time. Phil Weiser is probably more progressive than polis but interested to see what other names throw their hat in the ring  \n- u/avocadofan:\n    Polis’s political career in the Democratic Party should be over after this, but he has the money to follow his aspirations. Maybe he’ll continue his love affair with Elon Musk and go MAGA.\n- u/general-noob:\n    Dude really nuked his future political career in the last year here.\n- u/Outside_Abroad_3516:\n    What the FUCK.\n- u/kleric42:\n    I can't wait to not vote for him in the next primary.\n- u/YugoAKBestAK:\n    Jared Polis wants to take away your rights to own a gun to stop you from being able to resist the economic tyranny he wishes to inflict on the rest of us. Its nearly $10 for a dozen eggs at the grocery store, its insanity!\n    - u/philn256:\n        You can buy several hundered eggs by trading in your assult weapon that accepts detachable magazines and has a threaded barrel. Better yet, go see a blue haired mental health specialist. You don't seem happy.\n- u/stinky___monkey:\n    It’s all rigged\n- u/spunnee:\n    Of course he does. He’s been silent about his own agency’s rape kit backlog for 121 DAYS! He doesn’t care about people.\n- u/RicardoNurein:\n    Of course.\n    \n    D governor, D Senate, D House. \n    \n    One phone call could have fixed it all - in January, not June.\n",

         "\n\n===Comments===\n- u/Snoo-43335:\n    She will say what ever it takes to get elected then go on her own agenda again just like the last time. There is a reason she was voted out.\n    - u/DavidThi303:\n        She discussed her votes a lot in her interview with Kyle Clark and a bit with me. Her district is moderate and therefore any representative who wants to get reelected in it needs to be moderate.\n        \n        So yeah, she'll be moderate. And that will have you (and me) at times wishing she would be more liberal. But that's her district.\n        - u/ifinewnow:\n            But moderate doesn't have to mean things like taking away voting rights from residents of DC for their local elections. It had zero bearing on citizens in CO. She was punching down on people with her own background. Scaredy-scaredy behavior IMO, giving aid and comfort not to moderates but to reactionaries. I'm done with her.\n            - u/DavidThi303:\n                I'm reticent to be too quick to put boundaries about what's acceptable for a moderate. Governor Ritter was anti-abortion and yet he was a really good governor in my opinion. We're losing the purple states, have lost the Senate, and may find the Presidency impossible in 2032 after redistricting.\n                \n                I think we should embrace any moderate that can win and look closely at what they do.\n                - u/Thorbjorn_DWR:\n                    Boooooooooooooo\n                    - u/DavidThi303:\n                        I take it you prefer to lose while fighting the good fight rather than win by compromising? How's that working right now with Trump?\n                        - u/Express-Doubt-221:\n                            Kamala Harris ran around rural Pennsylvania with Liz Cheney, saying the only difference to Biden is that she'd appoint a Republican to her cabinet. Didn't run on any left issues. Didn't talk about trans issues, even to rebut Republican talking points. How did compromise work out for her?\n                            \n                            \n                            Do you think we should just run further and further right wing candidates? Maybe recruit Bush and Romney to run as compromise solutions, in order to peel off five remaining undecided voters in Wisconsin? And when that inevitably fails and we lose again, will we just keep trying, or will we run a populist left candidate that actually excites people?\n                            \n                            \n                            I've tried doing the thing you're doing. \"C'mon now guys. You need to eat your vegetables and you need to remember to vote for Democrats. I know we don't like them but they're better than getting Republican diabetes!\" It doesn't fucking work. Stop. \n                            - u/DavidThi303:\n                                Kamela Harris basically run as an extension of the Biden administration. I think she could have separated a little but she didn't. That means she ran on:\n                                \n                                * Not having anything to say on inflation other than it's coming down.\n                                   * I don't think they ever truly understood how upset people were about inflation. They had their economists telling them that the inflation was addressed by raising pay - that doesn't work.\n                                * Not having built anything over 4 years.\n                                   * Yes a little actually got built, that Biden rarely went out to celebrate. But most of the money approved was still jumping through approval hoops 4 years later.\n                                * Coming out for Trans equality.\n                                   * Speaking as a father of three daughters who played very competitive sports, I am not wild on a trans player on women's team. They have a giant advantage in upper body strength.\n        - u/toggiz_the_elder:\n            How did “being moderate” work out for her though? It was hard to tell her commercials from Gabe Evans’.\n- u/jbone9877:\n    She fucking sucks. Insane democrats just keep trying to run losers when someone like little bitch Gabe Evans should be an easy target\n    - u/DavidThi303:\n        Can we please keep it civil with no crude attacks. Politics is degraded enough as it is.\n        \n        I'm not asking you to state a different opinion, just to state it in a more civil manner.\n        \n        My $0.02\n        - u/dkillers303:\n            Meh, they’re right though. Many people have been loudly voicing, civilly, their disdain for democrats like Yadira. That’s gotten us nowhere. She does fucking suck, I am in her district. I strongly dislike Gabe, I strongly dislike Yadira, I want someone more progressive and the dems keep pushing the establishment losers.\n            \n            Until democrats get the message, I don’t see what your issue is with calling a loser a loser. She lost for a good reason, and now she wants to run again? We voted her out, why are you pushing her here? How about we listen to the voters and run a different democrat, someone who’s actually going to work for US?\n            - u/DavidThi303:\n                My objection was not to \"loser,\" it was mainly to \"little bitch\" and a bit to \"fucking sucks.\" I don't like Evans either but there's better ways to say that.\n                \n                As to who I interview, I try to interview all the candidates (some decline). And I respect that Caraveo is the only Democrat who's won that district. Someone else might be better, both campaigning & legislating. But maybe not. That's why we have a primary.\n                - u/dkillers303:\n                    As an interviewer, you also have a responsibility to report on what voters want and how candidates align with their values. Part of the reason we’re in this mess is because the media has been complicit and one-sided. We don’t want Yadira, we don’t want Gabe, but these are the people the media focus on because that’s what the two parties want to push. Maybe let’s talk about other options?\n                    - u/DavidThi303:\n                        I'll interview anyone else who's willing. I think I did ask here good questions on a number of policy issues.\n                        \n                        I do **not** think it's my job to tell them their answers are not what I want them to advocate for. My job is to get them across in the most detail, not inject my opinion. My opinion is irrelevant.\n                - u/Snoo-43335:\n                    This is why Democrats are losers. They are more worried about the words than the message.\n                    - u/Desertnord:\n                        As a democrat I agree\n                    - u/DavidThi303:\n                        I'd like to keep it civil in this subreddit. If you're in a crowd at a Trump event, let loose however you want.\n                        \n                        As to winning/losing, I think we're losing in purple districts because the candidates and the national party message is too progressive. We need to move to where the votes are.\n                        \n                        Matt Iglesia had a great example for the Dems. Working to increase foreign aid quietly - great. Working to reduce carbon emissions loudly - losing message.\n        - u/jbone9877:\n            Yadira loves abusing her staffers and you think she deserves civility. You should run for office, you will fit right in\n            - u/DavidThi303:\n                My mom was a state Rep for 30 years. My sister was a state Senator for 8 years. I know the world.\n                \n                It doesn't cost you anything to make the same points without being a dick.\n                - u/ifinewnow:\n                    OMG! You used the word 'dick' thereby being one. Shame shame.\n                    - u/DavidThi303:\n                        I did that hoping someone would call me out on it. Correct, I should not have said \"dick.\"\n- u/Express-Doubt-221:\n    The way you lecture others in the comments about being \"uncivil\" or \"too partisan\" makes me like your candidate even less, and I know little about her. Read the room. The left is sick of Democrat's shit. \n    - u/abitbuzzed:\n        Yup, fucking amen. Caraveo is absolutely terrible, and she already lost to Evans bc WE DON'T WANT HER PRETENDING TO REPRESENT US ANYMORE. She's useless at best and a turncoat at worst. OP is delusional if they think she has anything positive to offer. Even interviewing her was a waste of time and shows just how out of touch OP is with what the people in our district want. \n        \n        Plus, their bizarre attempts to police the language in this thread make it obvious that their issues with being out of touch and failing to read the room are not isolated to their \"reporting\". It's like this is OP's first day on reddit, lmfao.\n    - u/DavidThi303:\n        I'm sick of a lot of what the Democrats do too. But they're worlds better than the Republicans and that's the choice we have. Also I am not a Caraveo supporter. I'll support whoever wins the primary.\n        \n        And once we Democrats figure out how to win back the Senate and win the Presidency, then we can look at how to move the party to the left where we can, without losing those wins.\n        - u/Desertnord:\n            People have figured it out, but it doesn’t benefit the rich. This can’t in any realm be “the only choice we have”. Is she the only democrat in the state??\n            - u/DavidThi303:\n                I'm sure 1 or 2 additional candidates that have a decent chance will run. And when they announce I'll ask them if I can interview them too.\n        - u/Express-Doubt-221:\n            Democrats need to quit the whole \"we can talk about moving left when we win in the general\" spiel. We're not on some rail where the populace is gradually becoming more left and we just have to wait out the tantrumming Republicans. A third of the country doesn't vote and I imagine it's because to them, the parties effectively ARE the same. A Democratic party that actually fights for something is a party that wins. \n- u/DavidThi303:\n    Two comments about Caraveo. First, she comes across really well in the interview. That's not a sufficient reason to vote for her, but it is a positive data point.\n    \n    Second, there's a number of active Democrats trying to get her to drop out of the primary. **That's wrong.** We primary voters should be the ones making the decision on who we want as our candidate. We should not have a small group limiting our choices.\n    - u/Fishy1911:\n        We are limited to 2 parties. . So yeah, already have a small pool of idiots to choose from, picked by their respective party. Maybe if we could get ranked choice voting we could get someone who actually represents the people? \n        - u/dkillers303:\n            We had ranked choice voting on the ballot and for some reason, it didn’t pass :(\n            \n            I can’t stand Colorado politics sometimes. I’ve had multiple friends and colleagues complain to me about how we need a new voting system and proceeded to describe ranked choice voting. I told them it was on the ballot they voted on and they didn’t even realize… my god, it’s like we have this booklet that gets mailed with our ballot that explains these things. Instead of reading it, voters skim the issue or didn’t get told how to vote on it so they just vote against it.\n            - u/Fishy1911:\n                Concerted disinformation campaign from the parties that could've lost power.  Did you expect them to go quietly?\n                - u/dkillers303:\n                    Nope, but I expected more from CO voters. As one of the most educated states in the country, we’re an embarrassment.\n                    \n                    Disinformation campaigns are pretty easy to see through when you’re educated about the issues… CO has been somewhat okay in that regard over the years, but this last election was bad and I fear it’ll continue getting worse as more folks tune out.\n                    - u/Fishy1911:\n                        Its not too surprising,  honestly. We're just as susceptible to fear mongering as anyone else, especially when it's a constant insidious message. We get bombarded with its \"dems vs repubs\" and if there is any shift in the balance of power the other side will trample our rights, and \"blue all the way down\" keeps promoting the same message. Is it any wonder that voters are afraid if they get a 3rd party in that the side they more closely align with will fail to the other? \n                        \n                        \n                        Colorado has been the leader in a lot of areas, but even educated people weigh choices and aren't immune to being swayed by political propaganda. We're not all educated in law to dig through the minute parts of a bill and to be able to connect it to what might happen.  We depend on the blue book and discussion.. and ads.\n                        \n                        \n                         At the end of the day most people are busy and depend on others to help them do their thinking.  In our house, I'd like to think we discuss the issues/candidates a bit more but there are always some where I don't vote on or check the local pages to see other's opinions. There are times I ask my wife or she asks me about issues on the ballot that we hadn't heard much about, and we blindly go with the other's choice. \n                        \n                        \n                        Its hard to get mad at votes that don't radically change the system.  Its easier to vote NO than yes and keep the status quo for a lot of people, especially older ones. \n            - u/Snoo-43335:\n                The voice of the uneducated voter.\n    - u/ifinewnow:\n        coming across really well is not a data point. What metrics are you using?\n        - u/DavidThi303:\n            My opinion of how she comes across is a data point. Measuring the opinion of a random sample of 150 viewers of the interview - that's statistically valid.\n            \n            So fair point, I should have said \"In my opinion...\"\n",

Great...\n- u/Wooly_Mammoth_HH:\n    Is that like.. cult stuff?\n    - u/oo0oo:\n        Dianetics is the main belief system of Scientologists, so yeah... a major cult.\n        - u/flybydenver:\n            I remember seeing prime time TV ads for the book in the 90s\n            - u/DryIsland9046:\n                It was a really successful tool for the cult.  Along with tv and radio ad campaigns, the church of scientology used to keep Dianetics on the bestseller list by buying back hundreds of thousands of copies from retailers, and then re-re-selling them as wholesale back to the bookstores.   In some of the documentation above, B-Dalton (a massive mall bookstore chain at the time) used to talk about getting wholesale books from the publisher already wearing the b-dalton price stickers.  (because the cult members just bought them off the shelves, and then pretended they were new wholesale books.). All to juice the sales numbers to keep it perpetually on the bestseller list.  So they could pretend Dianetics was a legitimate popular self-help book.  \n                \n                It was nuts.   But they never needed to turn a profit on the books.  It was just a big loss leader to get people into the cult so they could go after their life savings.\n        - u/DryIsland9046:\n            Well, it's the \"first taste is free\" part of the belief system.  Mostly a bunch of pseudoscientific hogwash around the \"analytical mind\" and the \"reactive mind\" purportedly where people store their trauma.    Although just nonsense from a failed science fiction author, it almost sounds plausible.\n            \n            Then the next step is to steer you to a Dianetics Center.  Where they start with a \"personality test\" that involves a galvanic skin response low-grade lie detector.  No mater what the \"e-meter\" says, it turns out you're \"storing trauma! in your reactive mind.\"   And the cure for that imaginary disease is, of course, more courses from the church of scientology.  \n            \n            As you get deeper into the cult, you pay fees to pass certain \"levels\" which gradually reveal to you more \"truths.\"  Namely that the \"reactive mind\" comes from (and I wish I was making this up) immortal space aliens (thetans) who possess your brain and body, because they were banished to earth because of an evil galactic overlord, Xenu.   And tied to volcanoes, etc.   And the personality test measures the number of aliens that posess you.   And those aliens are the source of all your hangups/problems/woes.  And the cult has the only means of vanquishing these aliens from your body/mind.

Destroying the NPS will only hurt the budget, not help it.\n    - u/krpaints:\n        National Parks generated $55 billion in revenue last year on a $3.6 billion budget. This is absolutely not about “efficiency”\n- u/repeatablemisery:\n    What good will calling them do? Every time I've done that I get some form of \"this is how I feel so I'll be voting this way.\"\n    - u/cmmurf:\n        Someone listens to your call and summarizes it by ticking a box that says \"protect the parks\" or \"parks can suck my dong\".\n        \n        The tick marks get tallied up, and your Congresscritter is informed anytime there's a large discrepancy between their position and their estimate of what incoming phone calls should be supporting.\n        \n        So it really does matter. Just not in the personalized way you might wish it worked. Therefore, keep your messages short and on point. If you prattle on with a bunch of random disorganized complaints, I suppose around 30 seconds they check a box \"incoherent\" and delete the voicemail and move on.\n- u/Fearless-Rub-cunt:\n    What a mess\n- u/ArtyBerg:\n    The same reps and senators that were completely fine with gutting and stretching CPW?\n    - u/emphasisonass:\n        Sadly, no. Seems all of our state reps are fine with taking money from our parks. Dems for gun classes and Reps because \"small government\". I hate it here sometimes🫠🫠\n        - u/Hypnotoad2966:\n            They took one of the only good things the government has done lately in the park permit program and ruined it.\n    - u/sunkenbeetle:\n        No the ones in DC that want ruin our parks so they can sell them off.\n- u/NMBruceCO:\n    I wish people would wake or learn that he doesn’t care about America\n    - u/BurmecianDancer:\n        People have learned that. Cultists have not.\n        - u/NMBruceCO:\n            personally I am not sure about that, because I dont think it was only the cult people who voted for him\n            - u/RainDownAndDestroyMe:\n                Nearly 90 million Americans that were eligible to vote did not. They're also to blame.\n                - u/NMBruceCO:\n                    agree.\n- u/smgkid12:\n    Don't worry, the pilfering that SB 003 will do to the CPW fund will do that already.\n- u/demonmonkeybex:\n    These motherfuckers…\n- u/lethjakman:\n    Don’t give in. Call your representatives. Protest. Their votes are your votes and they will change if they hear enough voices. This administration thrives when we give up.\n- u/RainDownAndDestroyMe:\n    Orange douchebag already cost me the job I worked my ass off for, and now he's going to destroy our nation's national parks?\n    \n    If only Americans were warned...\n- u/profuseAmbrosia:\n    Support our government and stop democratic wasteful spending. We don’t need to spend our hard earned money going to woke programs and defending illegals nor do we need to pay to enjoy nature. National parks can operate like open space parks. Free to all for all to enjoy. Not just for the rich that can afford it.\n- u/crithema:\n    It's impossible to get into RMNP most of the year, I feel like the park is already gone.\n- u/Old_Union_3208:\n    I’m not in favor of this but the article is misleading. The 2025 NPS budget was $3.6B.\n    A $900M cut would be a 25% cut in funding. Most Federal agencies are being asked to cut 20% in an effort to cut overhead. Perhaps the best we can hope for is regressing to the 20% cut.\n- u/AquafreshBandit:\n    Why would calling matter? Trump sat back and did nothing while a mob was looking for his own Vice President. And people voted for him anyway. He’s far more of a threat to members of Congress if they don’t do what he wants.\n- u/Mysterious-Entry-357:\n    Except Everglades NP.  They can close that one.  Gators, crocs, snakes, panthers, and a dozen other creatures that want to eat you.  Never been so happy to pack up and go home.\n",

         "\n\n===Comments===\n- u/JeffInBoulder:\n    Lots more good info here:\n    \n    https://www.colorail.org/colorado-rail-passenger-news/joint-service-study-demonstrates-hope-for-passenger-rail\n    \n    Tl/dr; the state is planning to move ahead with multiple passenger rail projects, feds be damned.\n    - u/piggy2380:\n        Trying not to let perfect be the enemy of good, and I’ll take whatever I can get here in this current climate, but I’m a bit worried about the “limited service” for FRPR of 3 RTs per day. I understand the need to get something done to instill confidence and I hope it works out, but I don’t think even 5 RTs would be enough service to be all that useful to most people. I can already see the amoebas coming out of the woodwork saying “the 3 RTs aren’t even full, why would we increase to 5 or 10??” and it getting stuck in low-service purgatory forever.\n        \n        At an absolute minimum, I think we need 6 RTs per day in addition to a night train (after midnight) for any serious ridership to build up. And it really shouldn’t be all that much more money than the limited service plan ideally (but of course, negotiating with freight companies will be a nightmare I’m sure).\n        - u/Fuckyourday:\n            A sleeper train to Steamboat would be pretty cool. Go to sleep on the train in Denver, wake up in Steamboat as the sun rises. It's like you teleported there.  \n              \n            Not sure if it would take long enough to get a proper sleep, that would be my only concern. I assume it would be similar to the train to Glenwood which takes 6 hours. They'll share the same track until Bond where the new train will split off to head to Steamboat.\n            - u/piggy2380:\n                That would be cool. To be clear though, I’m mostly talking about the FRPR from Fort Collins to Denver. I think a Steamboat train would be as wildly successful as the Winter Park train has been no matter what, even at 1 RT per day, since it would be mainly used for ski commuting and not day-to-day transit\n                - u/Fuckyourday:\n                    Oh I see, gotcha. Yeah I agree with your points about FRPR. That train is honestly much more important as it connects the majority of the state's population, it should be done right. Seems like lack of federal funding due to the current government is an issue. What would be the purpose of the night train?  \n                      \n                    However, I have a feeling even with 3 RT per day it will be packed, I think there is a serious demand for good intercity transit here. Just look at the success of Bustang. And that's with slow mixed traffic buses. I just hope it's reliable and isn't plagued by delays related to freight traffic.\n                    - u/piggy2380:\n                        A night train would be for people traveling to Denver for events like sports, concerts, shows, etc to be able to get back without paying for a hotel. Lack of night service is also probably the one thing holding Bustang back from being a truly useful service, because it doesn’t capture that demographic of people at are who are a large contingent of commuters. \n                        \n                        Only being useful to 9-5 commuters is a trap a lot of transit projects fall into even though that’s a quickly shrinking portion of people. It should be useful for anyone who wants to go back and forth from Denver for any reason at any time, otherwise they’ll just drive. IMO level of service is a more important thing than travel time - I can sit for 2 hours on a train even though driving would be 1 hour, but if I want to dip down to Denver for a nice dinner but the last train leaves at 7pm and I’d either have to eat at 5 or get a hotel, I’ll just drive.\n                        - u/Fuckyourday:\n                            Good points\n        - u/brinerbear:\n            I think they should do it but with limited service you probably have to spend the night at a hotel.\n            - u/piggy2380:\n                Yeah I agree they should still do it if it’s a choice between limited service or nothing at all. But yeah, if I’m going down for a show or a dinner and it’s a choice between spending another $200 on a hotel or driving, even someone who loves trains like me and hates cars is probably going to drive.\n                - u/brinerbear:\n                    But in some areas I am really disappointed with the lack of hotels.\n    - u/TechGuruGJ:\n        Hell yes! Feds be motherfuckin damned!\n    - u/brinerbear:\n        As they should.\n- u/rtd131:\n    This is awesome news. \n    \n    It would be great if they could make the Rollinsville stop happen. They could easily add a through bus service to Blackhawk/Central City and to Eldora.\n    - u/RatherBeInThePond:\n        Makes no sense not to put a stop there for that very reason. Could also be great for Rollinsville. I have been hoping that they would do something like this since the project was announced. I live outside Boulder, so driving the hour to this spot is preferable to me than riding the train that time between Denver and Rollinsville, while also having to drive back the 25. I could only assume that would be the same story for many of us in this region.\n        - u/rtd131:\n            Yep! \n            \n            They could call it Blackhawk/Eldora, something like that and get a ton of riders year round. It's only a 10 minute drive to Eldora and 20 minutes to Blackhawk. Honestly wouldn't save a ton of time for most people but would get a ton of riders, and cut down on traffic/drunk driving down from Blackhawk.\n            - u/JeffInBoulder:\n                It would work in the other direction also... could drive from Boulder to Rollinsville and park there for a quick hop through the Moffat to WP.  If they put a stop on 93 its less important, but until that happens it's about the same drive to Union Station but a much shorter train ride and no need to deal with parking downtown.\n            - u/RatherBeInThePond:\n                It would be easy for Blackhawk when they already have those shuttles running all the time between the casinos, just divert one to and from the train a couple times a day and you are good.\n        - u/Fuckyourday:\n            This could also be great for commuting workers of Winter park, who could live in Rollinsville or nearby Nederland and have short train commute rather than a 90+ minute drive. That could really revitalize Rollinsville, adding some new housing/apartments/businesses on its historic main street which looks like a shell of what it once was when trains stopped there.  \n              \n            Could also be cool to have additional transit-accessible hike/bike/backpacking options from Denver. And if it had a timed shuttle to Eldora I'd totally use that for downhill and cross country skiing from Denver without needing to drive.\n- u/grant_w44:\n    Trains :)\n- u/bpwelcome7:\n    This is so fucking cool! I hope it's a huge success and the I-70 corridor takes note.\n    - u/bluecifer7:\n        This is being done because these rails already exist. Putting rail along the I70 corridor is ridiculously expensive and not happening this century. A BRT would be a better solution for that at this point\n        - u/grant_w44:\n            You mean a dedicated bus lane?\n            - u/bluecifer7:\n                Yep, a lane that is bus only, no other traffic - ideally completely blocked from the road so dumbasses can't break the law and get in it to crash. It's the same principle as the Colfax BRT\n            - u/rtd131:\n                The express lane should be bus only\n        - u/rtd131:\n            Technically they could run a train through Moffat tunnel down to Eagle on existing tracks. \n            \n            It would be ~5 hours to get up there but I could see a weekend service working. Better to spend 5 hours on the train with comfy seats and a bar than 5 hours in traffic.\n        - u/TechGuruGJ:\n            BRT would undoubtedly be great but would that really solve the main congestion issues of I-70, which is largely poor weather and environmental impact?\n            - u/bluecifer7:\n                Congestion on I70 is regularly not poor weather, it’s far too many people attempting to drive all at once in poor weather. Imagine I70 but every skier in west Denver/Lakewood/Golden and tourists coming from the airport are on a BRT. (Assuming it follows the Bustang route) That’s a HUGE amount of cars no longer on the road \n- u/wildtech:\n    The plan is to restore rail service all the way to Craig. With an ever increasing workforce for Steamboat located in Craig, this would be a godsend. It would also restore the passenger rail service that ended in 1968.\n- u/NonPartisanFinance:\n    Be in private (like in Florida) or public the market is absolutely there for passenger rail. Wish it was high speed like in Florida, but I am absolutely not complaining! \n    \n    Maybe a little because I loved the old small town of steamboat and this will increase traffic to the old ranch town. A worthy sacrifice I guess.\n- u/DavidThi303:\n    They need to add the ability to have it also take your car. So you have transportation to get around in Steamboat.\n",

Might be top of my list just for how many of them there are (like a dozen dedicated veggie ones??), and how many I love. Their BBQ tempeh, eggplant parm, and the one just called \"the veggie\" are my fave faves, but honestly I've never had any of them I dislike. \n    \n    - [Cheba Hut's](https://chebahut.com/menu/) veggie section is likewise very good. They've got your crunchy bread on lock. I like the Magic Mushroom a ton, and the Griefo as a mood-based alternative. If you have the choice, IMO their Longmont location is much better than the Boulder branch, but nbd if that's too far out of your way. \n    \n    - [Southern Sun's](https://www.mountainsunpub.com/menu-southern-sun-pub-and-brewery/#sandwiches-copy-1) Boom Boom sandwich is pretty lit, though not nearly as beefy (haha) as the other entries on this list\n    \n    - Scrooge Bahn Mi's tofu version was pretty great, and veggie-friendly Bahn Mi that's also authentic isn't an option you see in our area often\n    \n    - [Zodiac Subs](https://www.zodiacsubs.com/ordering/restaurant/menu?restaurant_uid=4822e69f-eff5-41d7-8753-dac8497f1a77&client_is_mobile=true) has a couple quality veggie choices; \"the perfectionist\" is a fave.\n    \n    - The Veggie Melt from [Potbelly](https://www.potbelly.com/menu/sandwiches) scratches a very specific itch. I'd never choose it over Half-Fast's hot sandwiches, but idk, sometimes you're just already at 29th street or don't have time to wait for HF\n    \n    - And lastly, for price point alone, don't sleep on the Sprouts deli counter. You can BYO for $5.99, a price point you can't find *anywhere* anymore in this economy, and since they feel bad that it's veggie they load that thing TF UP with whatever you want added to it, and IME rarely charge for some of the items that would otherwise be add-ons that cost extra (like the olive tapanade... mmmmmm). The sourdough is the biggest sandwich bread.\n    - u/StoneyMcTerpface:\n        I went to Cheba Hut (in Longmont) today for the first time in probably 15 years and had the the \"Power Plant\" hummus/avocado sub and it was really good. I will definitely be back.\n        - u/aydengryphon:\n            The Longmont Cheba Hut in particular is, for some reason, an extremely extra-good iteration of the chain lol.  That sub is delicious too, I've had that one!\n- u/Thenikkibirdy:\n    I agree with most of the recs above but I wanted to add one that wasn’t mentioned: Naked Lunch has this Brie and Apple sammy with honey mustard and greens that was so good!\n- u/More_Tale5951:\n    Best veggie sandwich used to be at Mountain Sun but sadly it’s no longer on the menu.\n- u/flovarian:\n    Had a good grilled veggie sandwich from Curtis Park on 30th a while ago, and am a fan of the Boom Boom sandwich and the tempeh Reuben at Mountain/Southern Sun Pubs.

         "\n\n===Comments===\n- u/EDMSauce_Erik:\n    It’s an expensive sport because of the price of gear and the initial intro course. It’ll be around $5-$6K to get started. We take off primarily from Community Foothills Park in Boulder, but Golden also has a launch for much more advanced pilots. The launch in Boulder is like 800ft up the ridge, and you run down the slope on the ridge until the wing is over your head and you can lift off from the side of the hill. \n    \n    Then you have to catch upward air drafts called thermals to be able to fly from North Boulder to Golden or really anywhere else. \n    \n    Incredibly fun sport, and does have a high barrier to entry but once your gear is bought and you’ve learned - it’s totally free. I highly recommend it, but make sure to take your time with the sport. It’s statistically no more dangerous than Mountain Biking but can get insanely dangerous if you don’t go at your own pace and listen to your instructors. \n    \n    I recommend Boulder Free Flight or Red Tail to learn in Boulder.\n    - u/Antique-Belt1204:\n        ^ this guy knows.  Take a tandem with one of the local operations, and if you enjoy it, reach out to the teachers in town and see who you connect with. Proper paragliding requires proper mentorship.\n    - u/RowenaOblongata:\n        Add to those figures... $450K to cover your medical bills and rehab when you crash and have a TBI.\n        - u/EDMSauce_Erik:\n            Same can be said with any extreme sport. As I said, paragliding is no more dangerous than mountain biking. Just because something you don’t understand intimidates you, doesn’t mean you have to be a voice attempting to intimidate others. The sport is as safe as you want to make it.\n            - u/Sad_Expression_8779:\n                I know some folks who paraglide so I’m not shitting on the sport here, but I don’t think it’s true that the risk profile is the same as mountain biking. If you get injured paragliding the risk of the injury being catastrophic is high. If you get injured mountain biking you’re most likely looking at arm/hand/clavicle breaks.\n                - u/EDMSauce_Erik:\n                    Completely disagree, though I understand why you think that not doing the sport yourself. The VAST majority of accidents in paragliding occur when taking off or landing like over 90%. Usually broken bones or muscular damage in the lower body as you’re at most a few feet off the ground. I think people have this thought that paragliders regularly just kind of plummet to the ground. That really never happens randomly and is almost always due to pilot error. Like especially on a beginner wing, the thing is fucking hard to cause it to drop out of the sky unless you’re active trying to cause it to collapse.\n                    - u/EDMSauce_Erik:\n                        I haven’t looked into peer reviewed materials and there is always issues with collecting this type of data as it demands accurate self reporting of incidents and extreme sports are kind of known for egos. That being said I really haven’t found anything ever that suggests paragliding statistically has great risks of bodily harm or death. I challenge you to find something though, as I have been going off of anecdotal articles. That being said Paragliding gets grouped with or confused with skydiving and base jumping, both of which (especially the latter) are incomprehensible more dangerous. Something like 3% chance of death while paragliding over 1000 hours and about the same for mountain biking. Base Jumping is like something insane like over 50% chance of death over 1000 hours.\n                        - u/IllegalStateExcept:\n                            I think you are probably right about it being as dangerous as mountain biking.  But [here is an article that estimates the danger to be about the same as downhill mountain biking which is probably more dangerous than typical mountain biking](https://chessintheair.com/the-risk-of-dying-doing-what-we-love/).  However, I don't think his estimates of the total number of flying hours are particularly accurate.  I'm guessing it is an under-estimate of the total flying hours which would decrease the accident rate significantly.    I know my log book is an under-estimate of my total flying hours.\n                    - u/yuropod88:\n                        When else would an accident happen? Broken bones and muscular damage while you're in the the air?\n                        - u/EDMSauce_Erik:\n                            The other 10% of accidents in this example would be from pilots in active flight (not landing or taking off) who fall to the ground due to mechanical failure, pilot error or extreme conditions.\n- u/Jaded_Philosophy_784:\n    *gal … it was me :)\n    - u/wolfenstein734:\n        Ahh how did you get into this?

My boss does this and he’s selling a couple he no longer uses and he’s asking 1800 for his\n        - u/IllegalStateExcept:\n            FYI it's strongly recommended that beginners find an instructor before buying gear. Your bosses gear may be great for someone. But beginners need very specific equipment to start safely.\n            - u/dyllionaire77:\n                Yeah for sure. He’s selling the ones he started with but he’s tall and weighs prob 60+ more than I. But yeah I’m determined to try it and he’s offered to help me get started whenever I’m ready\n                - u/IllegalStateExcept:\n                    Awesome! It is super useful to chat with people in the sport when getting into it.  The weight range is extremely important though.  You typically want to be at the upper end of the certified range for a wing as it makes learning safer and way more fun.  An instructor will also check the integrity of the fabric, length of the lines, and more.\n    - u/AndBeingSelfReliant:\n        Till you get a spinal cord injury\n        - u/justinsimoni:\n            Local flyer Cedar Wright got a spinal cord injury.

Broke every bone in face, skull, and parts of lower spine. Was in a coma for a while. Severe brain damage, he can’t choose words well but can think fine. Can’t pee on his own (needs catheters), uses a walker and can’t control his right leg. Gets monthly seizures. It’s been 2 years since the accident \n                \n                Definitely an argument to be made that some things are worse than death.

The allure is partly that you're riding updrafts essentially using nothing but several square meters of thin, silk-like fabric and a couple meters of paracord holding it all together.\n                - u/redplume:\n                    You can find a similar story for just about any activity imaginable, including walking across the street in a crosswalk. And while you might not succumb to traumatic injuries, you can find yourself pretty debilitated and unhealthy from a life of sedentary living.\n- u/SolidSnek1998:\n    Money.\n- u/HLOFRND:\n    There’s a local group that trains people out at a park in north Boulder.

It a chunk of change but still less than a used car and cars dont fly! Also I think most instructors will let you pay in installents.

No doubt they'll be happy to chat.\n    - u/Ryan1869:\n        Lookout mountain in Golden was a popular spot. You get the right winds they will carry you a long way from there\n- u/theHagueface:\n    I could see retired Air Force or Navy vets having the initial skills and confidence to take the first jump\n    - u/ExileOnMainStreet:\n        You launch from the ground or a slope.\n    - u/mister-noggin:\n        No, it’s pretty different from what the few jump certified vets would have experience with. \n        - u/whalewhisker5050:\n            There are a ton of jump certified vets that get into skydiving.

         "\n\n===Comments===\n- u/TheGamerXym:\n    Its nice of you to link it again, but they sent out an email on May 1st that they were ending their campaign for the year.\n    \n    > \"We’re ending our campaign for this year. But we’re not stopping our fight for community space in Boulder.\n    \n    \n    > In February, in response to the widespread yearning in Boulder for more safe, people-focused downtown space, we launched the Pearl For You initiative to restore pedestrianized community space on west Pearl Street. We have been absolutely humbled by the flood of support we’ve received from you and thousands of other Boulderites. And we are deeply grateful for every one of you.\n    \n    \n    \n    > Since February, the context for our initiative has shifted significantly. There’s the ongoing chaos and economic disruption created by the Trump Administration, including cuts to some federal funding, threats to other programs, and tariffs that are high and unpredictable, all of which put the city budget and the broader economy in a much weaker condition. There’s the Core Arterial Network (CAN) Downtown Study, which potentially intersects tightly with additional pedestrian spaces and whose timing and outcome is more uncertain than ever, as well as other potential city initiatives such as a Downtown Development Authority. And perhaps most importantly, and certainly most positively, the city won the Sundance Film Festival for 10 years starting in 2027, which will effectively require some downtown areas to be pedestrianized during the festival, and will set the stage for broader or longer-term changes.\n    \n    \n    \n    > This article lays it out: while there were numerous factors resulting in Park City and Salt Lake City losing the festival, their inability or refusal to provide more pedestrian space was a key one. Boulder, we’re confident, will want to avoid that same fate. Festival organizers and attendees alike will demand more pedestrian space downtown, both because it makes for a safer, more pleasant experience, and because motor vehicles are simply too space-inefficient to handle the throngs the festival will bring to the city. However, where exactly those changes will occur, and what they will look like, is yet unclear. In particular, streets adjacent to and connecting venues may be the best candidates for pedestrianization, and west Pearl may or may not be one of those.\n    \n    \n    \n    > This shifting landscape has led us to a difficult but clear conclusion: 2025 is not the year for this initiative. Too much is uncertain both nationally and locally, and there are both big risks and big opportunities for changes downtown. Combined, these factors make this process, at this time, not the right choice in our determination.\n    \n    \n    \n    > So while we remain unequivocally committed to creating additional downtown pedestrian space, and more clear than ever that there is overwhelming popular support for it, we are ending our ballot petition campaign for this year. But we are not going away. We are not going to stop fighting for a more people-friendly city, and we certainly are keeping the option open to bring the campaign back in a future year, including perhaps 2026. And we will keep you and our thousands of other supporters informed about how to stay involved.\n    \n    \n    \n    > Most importantly, we want to thank you for your support of our campaign. You’ve already made a difference by showing the broad demand for pedestrian-oriented, car-free spaces in our city. We will continue to fight for those spaces, and for you, in the months and years to come.\n    \n    \n    \n    >The Pearl For You team\"\n- u/BlackCatBonanza:\n    Boulder 0; Pasta Jay 2\n- u/zenos_dog:\n    I signed and you should too.  The merchants have yet to any downside at all for pedestrianizing that stretch.\n    - u/yoln77:\n        Curious what do you think is the reason why so many marchants are against it if you think there is only business upside for them? \n        - u/zenos_dog:\n            Fear.  The data from the closure during Covid doesn’t support their assertion of any impact at all.  Their sales tax numbers were slightly higher than Pearl st mall and 29th street.\n- u/5400feetup:\n    Meanwhile the energy used to “fight for community space” could be diverted to enjoying all the community space already existing in Boulder.  Granted, there aren’t many that offer picnic tables on asphalt but there are other options.\n- u/charte:\n    I cannot believe this petition only has ~1400 signatures. \n    \n    I genuinely cannot see any benefits of allowing car traffic along this block. West Pearl already has parking nearby in garages and on neighboring streets, businesses already get deliveries through the alleys, and it is among the most accessible areas in boulder by bike and bus.\n    \n    Returning West Pearl to a car-free block as it was during the pandemic would make it safer and more pleasant for pedestrians, especially at night when foot traffic increases and people have been drinking. Reducing vehicle traffic lowers the risk of accidents, creates a calmer atmosphere, and allows people to enjoy experiencing the area rather than just passing through it.\n    \n    Beyond simply being a nicer atmosphere, pedestrian zones are good for business. Cities around the world have seen increased foot traffic and retail spending in car-free areas. The Pearl Street Mall is a clear example as one of the most vibrant and economically successful parts of town. Expanding on what already works should be an easy win for the community.\n    \n    Please sign you name in support of a better downtown Boulder. Let’s expand the safe, lively, and walkable areas that make this city more enjoyable for everyone!\n",

         "I’ve posted about this in the past in another account that has since been deleted. We have had the same obnoxious alarm from the Xcel Valmont station going off since 9am. 5/10, 2025.\n\nAs you can hear, it is a brain-drilling-pierce-your-ever-lasting-soul sound than just goes on and on forever.\n\nYes, we’ve called Boulder PD (useless), now and in the past, and we’ve emailed Xcel’s Area Manager, Community Relations-Boulder Region & Mountain Communities, a Mrs. Jennings, before and the response has been somewhat swift. \n\nThis time however, we assume Mrs. Jennings is on vacation because of the email automatic reply.\n\nSo I ask, is there anyone in r/boulder that knows anyone at Xcel or that knows anyone at The sheriff’s office, or someone that works at the station to give the neighbors some insight as why a freaking alarm can go off for more than 12 hours straight with no action being taken?\n\nYou all might need to call 911 as I am about to start shooting at the plant!! (It’s a joke you guys) but maybe not.\n\n===Comments===\n- u/YakRancher:\n    Years ago, this was happening, and I drove up to the plant and spoke to them through the gate intercom. Not sure if there still is one, but have you tried that? The noise did resolve a short time later. I think in my case it turned out to be a locomotive that was idling on the tracks. It might be helpful if you could get a Boulder PD officer to do it as it is a violation of the noise ordinance and might  get more immediate attention if an officer did it.\n- u/toastyhandshake:\n    Go park nearby and honk your horn in opposing harmonic beeps until the police show up and tell you to stop.\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        Ha!!! That’s a great comment! I just want to sleep without an alarm going off, that’s all, not really looking to get tased or arrested for “noise disturbance”.\n- u/point_of_you:\n    That’s just the “Everything is OK” alarm\n- u/Lazy_Coconut7622:\n    Aside from the alarm being annoying, I’d be worried it’s… you know… indicating that something is wrong?!\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        That was my first thought too, obviously, as I live right across the station but from Mrs Jennings’ email the last time: “Our team is currently working on resolving a technical fault that led to the unintended sounding of alarms. We are also in the process of replacing the necessary components to prevent any further disruptions.” It seems it’s just an automated alarm that goes off every once in a while. The problem, again, is that no one in the station minds the fuxking noise and takes the necessary measures to shut it off until a neighbor complains.\n        - u/Lazy_Coconut7622:\n            It was nice of them to reply, but I’d still take that response with a grain of salt. We’ve already seen how well Xcel takes care of Boulder. 👀\n- u/Shdwdrgn:\n    Why not call one of the TV news stations, let them know Boulder PD refuses to respond, and ask why it takes more than a day to get this resolved when it keeps happening so often.\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        Good idea… I just thought maybe someone in this sub would know someone that could make it stop… but it’s a point I’ll take into consideration next time.\n    - u/AVeryHeavyBurtation:\n        Alert the boomers!\n        - u/Shdwdrgn:\n            I mean, since the media won't report on Trump's crimes, they need *something* to spend time on, right?\n- u/Merivel1:\n    That’s SUPER obnoxious. Have you tried calling/contacting general Xcel? Maybe they can funnel you to the right folks? https://www.xcelenergy.com/customer_support?sfmc_id=1080599623#supportphone\n    \n    Maybe contact the Colorado Public Utility Commission so they know Xcel is subjecting your neighborhood to this too.\n- u/ongoldenwaves:\n    Don't worry. The racers will soon be out hooning around and drown out the noises of the siren.\n    - u/Commercial_Star7216:\n        Somehow xcel is worse than the street racers\n    - u/A10co:\n        I’m in Broomfield and just read this as I hear them on 36. On their way now to lend their assistance!\n        - u/mynewme:\n            Listening now.\n    - u/ConsistentBuy5540:\n        As long as my toddler sleeps through the racers I’m ok with it while acknowledging total incompetence and ED of our BC police force.\n- u/Junglebyron:\n    Another reason among MANY to be angered that Xcel is an energy monopoly for our region, and can provide shit service and dangerous conditions for its consumers because we have no grid energy alternative.\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        Agreed… but there are no excuses for any company in the world to let an alarm go off for hours and hours, especially in residential areas where there is supposed to be a noise ordinance. And the fact that the Sheriff (unincorporated Boulder so BPD gets a pass I guess) does nothing but say “we’ll send someone out” or respond with “we couldn’t get a hold of anyone” infuriates me.\n        \n        Try throwing a party and have the music on 2 minutes after the noise ordinance set time and they’ll be on with 20 units all wearing body armor yelling as if you are a cartel (yes, I am projecting).\n        \n        Xcel sucks and we all know it, Corporate USA runs the country now. But the civil service that we pay for and that should be on our side, apparently is ok with “we couldn’t reach anyone so suck it up”. That is way more disappointing.\n    - u/SurlyJackRabbit:\n        Shit service?\n- u/Best_Mechanic_7007:\n    This is against code. I’d submit a written complaint to code enforcement. https://bouldercolorado.gov/services/code-enforcement-unit\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        Thanks for the link. I will surely use it next time!\n- u/nihilistic-simulate:\n    Monkeywrench Gang it\n- u/BalsamA1298c:\n    Share contact info for Mrs Jennings?\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        I’d rather keep this civil with Mrs Jennings but if you google search this: Area Manager, Community Relations-Boulder Region & Mountain Communities\n        \n        You get this:\n        https://www.google.com/search?q=Area+Manager%2C+Community+Relations-Boulder+Region+%26+Mountain+Communities&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS657DE657&oq=Area+Manager%2C+Community+Relations-Boulder+Region+%26+Mountain+Communities&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQRRgnGDvSAQgzMzU1ajBqNKgCE7ACAeIDBBgBIF_xBYBzVREA-0R7&hl=en-US&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8\n        \n        Maybe you can find her contact info. Although since it’s the weekend, you’ll probably get the same automated response from her email.\n        - u/BalsamA1298c:\n            Thank you! Yes - civility matters.\n- u/SimilarLee:\n    Holy shit, that must be so obnoxious to have going off for like ... a day?\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        Yup, this has happened maybe 5-6 times in the last 6-7 months. It usually gets “resolved within 48 (grueling) hours”… the issue I have is HOW THE HELL NO ONE IN THE STATION OR XCEL JUST SHUTS IT DOWN? I mean, they have to know there’s something wrong in the f*cking plant that gives Boulder the energy to survive!!! Maybe Xcel really does suck as bad as we all think they do?\n        - u/AquafreshBandit:\n            I can't recall the last time I saw smoke coming from the smoke stacks. Xcel's website says they still use the plant for natural gas but I'm not sure how often. I would guess there's not anyone there most of the time.\n            - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n                You are right, as far as I know the plant was decommissioned in 2017 as a coal/gas power plant so there is no vapor coming out of the stacks since then, but the station still is the HQ of most of the power in town.\n                \n                https://www.gem.wiki/Valmont_Station\n                \n                There are people in there.. 24/7 365.\n                - u/saryiahan:\n                    Nope, you are completely wrong. Most of that plant is empty. There are small generating units there but they are only used when demand is high and they are gas units. I work at a power plant for Xcel\n                    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n                        Good of someone that possibly knows what the heck goes on with an alarm like that going off for more than 12 hours and in some cases, days, to respond. Thank you for telling me I am completely wrong, can you completely enlighten us? If it has generating units that run sometimes, there should be people maintaining them, operating them and so on, correct? Or at least someone that works the security cameras? The security of the plant? Someone that may have, I don’t know, a walkie talkie that could let someone know when an alarm has been going off for that amount of time? I assumed that there are people in there because when they installed the solar farm across the reservoir, the people told us the plant was going to operate them.\n                        \n                        In any case, you have to completely agree that an alarm that goes off for hours and hours from a plant from a billion dollar company that boasts “reliability” and “community commitment” like where you work (oh, wait, yeah it’s exactly the company where you work) is unacceptable.\n                        \n                        I am right on that though?\n                        - u/saryiahan:\n                            Since that site is mostly unmanned no one would immediately know of the alarm. There are periodic checks on the units. During the summer operational personnel could be on site for an unknown amount of time but not 24 hours. From my understanding there are a few cameras on site that go to an offsite security department. What those cameras show I do not know. As for the alarm I completely agree. It is ridiculous that it is going on for that long of a period.\n                            - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n                                Woah! It’s hard to believe that that whole place is completely abandoned and not monitored by a single human being.\n                                \n                                Today I learned! Thanks for clearing it up.\n                                \n                                So what do we do in the future when it goes off? Any direct line to someone that we can contact? a number to a human being that can assist in shutting it off?\n- u/unnameableway:\n    Damn that’s fucking annoying lol\n- u/Bldrtrail:\n    I’m curious—have other neighbors complained?perhaps the more that send in emails, calls, etc, the more inclined Xcel or even the non emergency line would be to do something.\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        Yes the last time it happened, a bunch of people nearby DM’d me to get Mrs Jennings email and they wrote to her too. They also called dispatch.\n        \n        They are well aware, both the sheriff and Xcel, but still it happens and still I have to post it on Reddit until it’s turned off. Maybe the operators at the plant are fellow redditors?\n- u/Desperate-Ad4051:\n    Very interesting, this could be totally 100% unrelated but at 55th and Arapahoe, we've been having small internet outages for the last 24 hours.\n- u/Owlthirtynow:\n    God aweful!\n- u/Meizas:\n    How is Xcel still finding ways to annoy us without turning off power\n- u/mwdenslow:\n    This is very concerning. It seems like basic accountability to know what the alarm indicates, who's responsible and what the remedy is needed.\n    \n    I'd contact the PUC. They aren't likely to do much for you, but might cause Xcel to respond sooner. Also, I believe this is in the county.\n    \n    As you're likely aware there are serious ongoing contamination issues at this site. [https://boulderreportinglab.org/2024/03/03/boulder-county-holds-public-meeting-on-valmont-power-stations-toxic-coal-ash-to-address-community-concerns/](https://boulderreportinglab.org/2024/03/03/boulder-county-holds-public-meeting-on-valmont-power-stations-toxic-coal-ash-to-address-community-concerns/)\n    \n    I'd also appreciate you keeping us updated as you get more information.\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        Will do! As of now, it’s quiet. Hopefully I’ll get a response from Xcel tomorrow. If I do, I’ll update this thread.\n        \n        Oh, and thanks for the link, yes, we are well aware of the contamination issues there. Awful.\n- u/SurroundTiny:\n    I lived in Boulder in the late 90s. I heard it a couple of times then\n- u/Tryptrix:\n    Ms. Jennings is no longer the Boulder area Community Affairs person. I'll DM you the email of her successor.\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        You rock u/tryptrix!!\n        \n        Thank you!\n- u/ewhetstone:\n    That is enraging. I once had huge construction going on 30 feet from my bedroom window (they were excavating bedrock, it was LOUD and interminable) and got a noise app that saved my sanity: it’s called MyNoise (bad name) and it has a truly staggering number of sounds including a construction site white noise generator.\n    \n    Idk if there’s anything in their library that would cover this sound but maybe worth looking at it?\n- u/ZippyNomad:\n    As annoying as alarms can be, I truly hope the plant operators are safe.\n    - u/TripBogey5secPenVAR:\n        This is the boiler-plate PR response we got the last time this happened:\n        \n        We are aware of the issue and are actively working to address it. Our team is currently working on resolving a technical fault that led to the unintended sounding of alarms. We are also in the process of replacing the necessary components to prevent any further disruptions.\n        \n        During this period, we are making efforts to minimize the impact on the community by adjusting the siren settings temporarily. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that the issue is resolved promptly and efficiently, while keeping disturbances to a minimum.\n        \n        Lovely, ain’t it?\n        - u/ZippyNomad:\n            Then thank the maker that it wasn't a death at the facility.\n            \n            So yeah, while annoying when alarms malfunction and having to troubleshoot where the problem is, it could also be much worse. \n            \n            Speaking as someone who deals with noisy alarms while maintaining a safe work environment.\n",
